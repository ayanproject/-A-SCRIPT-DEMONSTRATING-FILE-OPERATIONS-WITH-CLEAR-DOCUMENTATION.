### **Project Title:**

**Create a Java Program to Read, Write, and Modify Text Files**

### **Project Description:**

This project focuses on building a **Java-based console application** that performs essential **file operations**—namely reading from, writing to, and modifying text files. The application demonstrates the practical use of Java I/O (Input/Output) capabilities, particularly classes from the `java.io` and `java.nio.file` packages. Developed using **IntelliJ IDEA**, this backend-only project provides clear, commented code and console-based output to validate the file operations.

File manipulation is a fundamental skill in Java, commonly used for data storage, configuration management, logging, and text processing. This project offers a complete demonstration of how Java can interact with file systems in a reliable and structured way.

### **Key Functionalities:**

1. **Reading from a Text File:**
   The application includes functionality to read the contents of a `.txt` file line by line. Using `BufferedReader` or `Files.readAllLines()`, it loads the text into memory and displays it in the console. This showcases how to handle file input efficiently while managing exceptions such as `FileNotFoundException`.

2. **Writing to a Text File:**
   The program allows users to write new content to a file using `BufferedWriter`, `FileWriter`, or `Files.write()`. The user can specify whether to overwrite the existing content or append to the file. This demonstrates how to safely output data to disk.

3. **Modifying a Text File:**
   The core logic also includes a simple mechanism to modify a file. The application reads the file content, updates the specific line or word based on a given condition (e.g., replacing a word or inserting a new line), and then writes the updated content back to the file. This mimics a basic find-and-replace functionality.

4. **Console Output and Logging:**
   Since there is no UI, the output of each file operation is clearly printed in the console, showing before-and-after states of the file. Proper logging and success/failure messages are provided for clarity.

5. **Exception Handling:**
   The application includes comprehensive exception handling for common I/O issues such as missing files, permission errors, or malformed input. This ensures that the application fails gracefully and provides meaningful error messages.

### **Technologies and Tools Used:**

* **Programming Language:** Java (JDK 17+)
* **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA
* **Java Libraries:** `java.io`, `java.nio.file`, `java.util`
* **Output:** Console-based (System.out)

### **Project Structure:**

The application is organized into modular methods for reading, writing, and modifying files, making it easy to test and extend. Each method is well-documented with comments, explaining the purpose, input, and output of the operation.

### **Conclusion:**

This project serves as a fundamental demonstration of how Java handles file operations using its robust I/O libraries. It is suitable for beginners to intermediate Java developers looking to understand the practical application of file handling in real-world use cases. The modular and well-documented nature of the program makes it reusable and easy to integrate into larger systems. This project also lays the groundwork for more advanced operations like file encryption, large file processing, or configuration-driven applications.
